For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
# Running the applications
## speed-detector
1. To run, run this command in terminal:
`node speed-detector/index.js`
2. It will prompt you to enter your speed.
3. Enter your speed and press Enter.
4. Your speed will return as 'Ok' if speed is less than 70, and your speed demerits will be returned if higher than 70.
